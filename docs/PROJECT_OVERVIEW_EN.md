# üìù Project Report: MC Server Launcher

## üìå Project Description

MC Server Launcher is a desktop application developed in Python using Tkinter that allows users to quickly download Minecraft servers, either in their Vanilla (official) or Forge (modded) versions. The main goal is to provide a simple and visual tool for users unfamiliar with the manual download and setup process of servers.

This tool aims to reduce the download process to just a few clicks, offering an intuitive interface with server type selection, version selection, and quick search capability.

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### 1. Application Structure

- Application developed with Tkinter.
- Separation between UI logic and download logic (`downloader.py`).
- Functional graphical interface: radio buttons for server type selection, combobox to choose version, and download button.

### 2. Implemented Features

- Fetching Vanilla versions from Mojang's official manifest.
- Fetching Forge versions from the official promos JSON.
- Proper version ordering by release date.
- Combobox with updated versions depending on the selected type.
- Search field to filter versions inside the combobox.
- Error handling (failed downloads, connection issues, etc.).
- Automatic download of the selected server `.jar` file into a specific folder (`servers/vanilla` or `servers/forge`).

### 3. User Interface

- Radio buttons to select between ‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù and ‚ÄúForge‚Äù.
- Combobox to choose the version.
- Centered and shorter input field to filter/search versions.
- Status labels to inform progress (loading, downloading, error, completed).
